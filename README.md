# Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!

In this game, your goal is to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 20 in as few attempts as possible. You have 20 attempts to correctly guess the number.

To play the game, simply enter your guess as a number between 1 and 20, and the game will tell you whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.

You can use the clues the game gives you to gradually narrow down the possible number and make more accurate guesses as you go along.
